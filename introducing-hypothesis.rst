What is hypothes.is?
====================

Hypothes.is is an awesome, game-changing system that lets you add
annotations to virtually any Web page or PDF document.  It's utterly
permissionless - the hypothes.is service is completely client-side,
so you can add and view annotations on any content to which you have
access.  This opens up a vast array of opportunities to attach
free-text information as well as relevant metadata to the scholarly
literature, and these opportunities are just beginning to be explored.

* Scientists are `already building structured annotations of scientific
  literature <https://hypothes.is/blog/annotating-to-extract-findings-from-scientific-papers/>`__.

* Hypothes.is has `helped nucleate a coalition of scholarly publishers
  <https://hypothes.is/blog/a-coalition-of-over-40-scholarly-publishers/>`__
  to explore and support the uses of annotation, broadly writ, for
  transforming scholarship by "enabling personal note taking, peer
  review, copy editing, post publication discussion, journal clubs,
  classroom uses, automated classification, deep linking, and much
  more."

* The service supports both public annotations and private "group"
  annotations, so annotation authors can choose how widely they want to
  broadcast the annotations.

* hypothes.is is working with the `Web Annotation Working Group
  <https://www.w3.org/annotation/>`__ and intends to be and remain
  standards compliant.
